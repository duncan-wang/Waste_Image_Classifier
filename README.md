# Waste Image Classifier

**Contributors: Jake Hogan, Sophie Courtemanche-Martel, Arnaud Guzman-Annes, Duncan Wang**

This repository walks through the process of how we can use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify and properly classify common waste items into their associated material groups. CNNs are a popular class of neural network architectures used in deep learning, and are commonly used to perform image classification. After being trained on images of waste items labelled by their associated material type, our goal is to enable the CNN to take an unclassified image of a waste item submitted by a user and generate a prediction representing the item's material composition. Though simple in nature, such a tool can be used to help inform user decision-making to reduce the quantity of improperly sorted waste items, so that everyone can play a role in improving the recycling process.
